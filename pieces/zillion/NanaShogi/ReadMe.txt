NanaShogi
---------
Invented by Georg Dunkel in 1998,1999
First implementation by Steve Evans, 1999
Complete checkmate rule implemented by Robert Price, July 2000


Nana-Shogi is perhaps the smallest non-trivial chess variant in 
existence. 
 
The following is based on Georg Dunkel's description of the game 
from his web pages <http://www.kolumbus.fi/geodun/nana/nana.htm>.

Nana Shogi is played on a 3x3 board. Each player has three cube 
shaped pieces, one conventional king and two pieces with four 
values each.
One piece has the values: Rook, Chariot, Swallow's Wings and 
Go-between.
The other piece has the values: Bishop, Tile General, Cat's Sword 
and Dog.
These pieces are taken from Shogi (Rook & Bishop), Chu Shogi 
(Chariot, Go-Between), Dai Shogi (Cat's Sword), Maka-Dai-Dai Shogi 
(Tile General) Wa Shogi (Swallow's Wings) and Tenjiku Shogi (Dog). 
 
At the commencement of the game the board is empty. Play begins 
with each player in turn (starting with black) dropping their king. 
Players may then choose at their turn either to drop a piece or to 
move a piece on the board.
Pieces (other than the King obviously) may be dropped in whichever 
value state the player chooses.
When a piece other than a King moves on the board, either with or 
without capturing, that piece's value changes. Values change 
sequentially; Rook to Chariot to Swallow's Wings to Go-between to 
Rook, etc and Bishop to Tile General to Cat's Sword to Dog to 
Bishop, etc.
It is illegal to drop any piece on the central square and it is 
illegal to check or to checkmate by dropping a piece. 
 
Under George Dunkel's rules it is also illegal to checkmate when 
one has one or more pieces in hand. This last rule was not 
implemented in the original zrf of Steve Evans.

Updated July 2000: Robert Price added this complete checkmate
rule. Steve Evans' implementation is retained as a variant.

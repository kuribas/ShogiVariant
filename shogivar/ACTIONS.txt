User moves on the board:
- board move event
- board subclass validates move (e.g. SmallShogiBoard::user_move)
- user_move calls ChessBoard::board_moves
- board_moves calls do_move on the player object, and notifies players
  and observers

Player moves without the board (e.g. chess engine, on server)
- player calls ChessBoard::player_moves
- ChessBoard::player_moves notifies other player and observers

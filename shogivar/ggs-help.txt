This is a short introduction to help getting started
at playing Shogi Variants at the Generic Game Server
quickly. For more info, look at the homepage for GGS:

http://external.nj.nec.com/homepages/igord/usrman.htm


Introduction:
=============

GGS can be used to play many different games.  Each gametype is
a Service.  For the shogi games this is /shs (Shogi Service).
For any commands related to the game (i.e. doing moves)
you should send information to the Service using the tell command (i.e. 
tell /shs play P-1e) 

Fortunately GGS provides a way not to have to do much typing: 
aliases (and variables).  When you type an alias it will be 
expanded to it's full command (together with any variables).
GGS Provides many usefull aliases to make life on GGS more 
pleasant.

Logging in:
===========

When logging in you will be asked for a name and a password.
If you aren't registered you can choose both freely.

Playing games:
==============

Make the Shogi Variant Service your current Game Service for
all future commands, by typing:
  ms /shs            (Make /shs current Service)

Tell it that you are open to play one game at a time:
  ts open 1          (tell /shs open 1)

Find an oponent who is ready to play:
  ts who 0

where 0 is the variant type (Regular shogi in this case)
type "ts help types" to get a list of supported variants.

Sending match request:
======================

  ts ask <variant> <player> 

A match request will be send to <player> if that player is
open for games.  

If you don't specify a player, a global match
request will be send to players that are open to global requests.

To tell the Service that you like to receive global match requests,
type:

  ts request +

To accept a match request, type:

  ts accept <.request>

Playing Moves:
==============

  tp <move>         (tell /shs play <move>)

Make move <move>.  Valid moves are:

  P-3f
  3g-3f
  P*5f

For a complete description type

  ts help moves

Please note that the notation 'x' for captures isn't used.
Use '-' for both moving and capturing.

  ts resign

Resign the game

Talking to People
=================

  t <player> <mesg>

t is an alias for tell

send the text <mesg> to player.  

With the '.' command you can talk to the person you where talking
to previously.

Talking to Channels
===================

You can also talk to channels using the tell command:

  t .chat Hi, everybody.
  t .shogi A question about Shogi...

Channels are created when they are used the first time.
To join a channel, type:
  
  chann + <channel>

To send a message to everyone in the .chat channel, you
can also use yell:

  y Hi, all

Registering
===========

To register, you must ask a sysadmin to register you.
You can find a sysadmin by typing:
  g _admin

You will see
: group _admin     2 : zardos otheradmin

Tell you want to register:
  t zardos I would like to be registered please
